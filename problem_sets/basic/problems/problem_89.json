Given a dataset represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a feature and its corresponding label, you are to design and implement a function 'balance_dataset'. The function should balance the dataset such that all labels are equally represented. If one label has more occurrences than another, you can randomly remove the extra tuples to achieve balance. For instance, if the dataset has [('f1', 'A'), ('f2', 'A'), ('f3', 'B')], the balanced dataset can be [('f1', 'A'), ('f3', 'B')] or [('f2', 'A'), ('f3', 'B')].",
